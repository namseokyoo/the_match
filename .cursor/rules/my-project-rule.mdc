- **Social Features**: Image galleries, match highlights, team showcases

## Future Business Features (Consideration)
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe for tournament fees
- **Premium Features**: Advanced analytics, custom branding
- **Subscription Model**: Monthly/yearly plans for organizers
- **API Monetization**: Third-party integrations

## Development Standards

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use async/await instead of promises where possible

### Component Architecture
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop types and interfaces
- Create reusable UI components in `/components/ui`
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Use compound components for complex UI elements

### Mobile-First Development
- Design for mobile screens first (320px+)
- Use responsive breakpoints: mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px)
- Implement touch-friendly interactions
- Optimize for thumb navigation
- Test on actual mobile devices

### Database & API Design
- Use RESTful API principles
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Create proper indexes for query optimization
- Implement soft deletes for important data

### Tournament Management Specific Rules
- Support multiple tournament formats: single elimination, double elimination, round robin, league
- Allow flexible team/player configurations
- Implement bracket generation algorithms
- Support real-time updates during matches
- Enable tournament scheduling and notifications

### File Organization
```

â”œâ”€â”€ utils/           # Helper functions
â””â”€â”€ styles/          # Global styles
```

### Security & Performance
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Optimize images and assets
- Use caching strategies appropriately

### Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Test responsive design across devices
- Perform accessibility testing

### Development Workflow
- Use feature branches for development
- Write clear commit messages
- Implement proper error logging
- Use development log for tracking progress
- Regular code reviews and refactoring

### Development Log & Reflection Process
- **Daily Log Updates**: Record all development activities in `dev-log.md`
- **Self-Reflection**: After each major task, conduct self-reflection and document:
  - What went well (ðŸŸ¢)
  - What needs improvement (ðŸ”´)
  - Action items for next development cycle (ðŸ”µ)
  - Technical considerations and lessons learned
- **Continuous Improvement**: Before starting new tasks, review previous reflections:
  - Check previous improvement points
  - Avoid repeating same mistakes
  - Apply learned best practices
  - Reference technical solutions from past work
- **Quality Assurance**: Use reflection insights to improve code quality, development speed, and decision-making
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintain clear visibility of project progress through structured logging

### Git & GitHub Management
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code only
  - `develop`: Development branch for integration
  - `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
  - `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production
- **Commit Convention**:
  - `feat:` New features
  - `fix:` Bug fixes
  - `docs:` Documentation changes
  - `style:` Code style changes
  - `refactor:` Code refactoring
  - `test:` Test additions or modifications
  - `chore:` Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- **Pull Request Process**:
  - Create PR from feature branch to develop
  - Require code review before merging
  - Use squash and merge for clean history
  - Delete feature branches after merge
- **Release Process**:
  - Merge develop to main for releases
  - Tag releases with semantic versioning
  - Deploy from main branch only

## Business Logic Rules
- Support multiple sport types and categories
- Allow custom tournament rules and scoring
- Implement user roles: admin, organizer, participant
- Support both public and private tournaments
- Enable tournament registration and management
- Track player/team statistics and history

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Implement consistent color scheme and typography
- Use intuitive navigation patterns
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Implement loading states and error messages
- Design for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Data Management
- Implement proper data validation
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Implement offline capabilities where possible
- Regular data backups and migration strategies
- GDPR compliance for user data
